##  Why Token Visualizer?

Working with Large Language Models means **tokens = money**. Every prompt you send costs based on token count, but most developers are flying blind:

- ❌ Copying prompts to OpenAI's tokenizer every time
- ❌ No idea which parts of their prompts are inefficient  
- ❌ Wasting money on verbose, unoptimized text
- ❌ No systematic way to compress prompts

**Token Visualizer solves all of this.**

###  Real Impact
```
Original prompt: 847 tokens → $0.0254 per request
Optimized prompt: 623 tokens → $0.0187 per request
Savings: 26% cost reduction → $67/month saved at 10K requests
```

    it through various validation and transformation steps in order to 
    return a properly formatted dictionary containing all relevant user 
    information that has been extracted and validated from the input.

##  Customization

### Color Themes
Modify the `Colors` class to customize the visual output:

```python
class Colors:
    RED = '\033[91m'      # Expensive sections
    YELLOW = '\033[93m'   # Medium efficiency
    GREEN = '\033[92m'    # Well optimized
    CYAN = '\033[96m'     # Headers
    # ... customize as needed
```

### Adding New Tokenizers
Extend support for additional models:

```python
def _load_tokenizer(self):
    if "your-model" in self.model_name.lower():
        return YourCustomTokenizer()
    # ... existing logic
```

### Custom Compression Rules
Add your own optimization patterns:

```python
verbose_patterns = [
    (r'\byour_pattern\b', 'replacement'),
    # Add custom patterns here
]
```

##  Performance & Benchmarks

### Speed Tests
| Text Size | Analysis Time | Memory Usage |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| 1KB | <0.1s | 2MB |
| 10KB | <0.5s | 5MB |
| 100KB | <2s | 15MB |
| 1MB | <10s | 50MB |

### Accuracy Comparison
Tested against OpenAI's official tokenizer:
- **Accuracy**: 100% match for GPT models with `tiktoken`
- **Fallback accuracy**: ~95% with word-based tokenization

---

##  Error Handling

The tool is designed to be robust and handle various edge cases:

### Graceful Degradation
- **Missing dependencies**: Falls back to word-based tokenization
- **Unknown models**: Uses sensible defaults
- **Invalid input**: Clear error messages with suggestions
- **File not found**: Helpful error messages

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "tiktoken not installed"
```bash
pip install tiktoken
```

#### Issue: Colors not showing
The tool automatically detects terminal capabilities and disables colors for non-interactive use.

#### Issue: Model not found
```python
# Fallback is automatically handled
visualizer = TokenVisualizer("unknown-model")  # Uses gpt-4 tokenizer
```

##  FAQ

### Q: How accurate is the token counting?
**A:** 100% accurate when using the official tokenizers (`tiktoken` for OpenAI models, `transformers` for others). The word-based fallback is ~95% accurate.

### Q: Can I use this with my own custom models?
**A:** Yes! You can extend the `_load_tokenizer` method to support custom tokenizers.

### Q: Does this work offline?
**A:** Yes, once dependencies are installed, everything runs locally.

### Q: What about privacy/security?
**A:** All processing happens locally. No data is sent to external servers.

### Q: Can I integrate this into my existing tools?
**A:** Absolutely! The `TokenVisualizer` class is designed for programmatic use.

### Q: How do I handle very large files?
**A:** The tool handles large files well, but consider processing in chunks for files >10MB.
